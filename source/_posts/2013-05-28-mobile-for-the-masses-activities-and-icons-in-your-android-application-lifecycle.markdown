My third article in [IBM developerWorks](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/)' series [Mobile for the Masses](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/views/java/libraryview.jsp?search_by=mobile+for+the+masses) is now out! [This hip article](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-mobileforthemasses3/index.html) covers the lifecycle events associated with `Activity` classes and then shows you how to implement menus and/or activity bars (for newer devices) along with associating icons for an app itself and its corresponding activity items. 

As the article summary states:

{% blockquote IBM DeveloperWorks http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-mobileforthemasses3/index.html Mobile for the masses: Activities and icons in your Android application lifecycle %}
The Activity class is the workhorse of an Android mobile app, and it's also where you can fine-tune your app's interactions with both the user and the mobile device. Get things working exactly the way you want them in your app's lifecycle, then use icons and action bars to guide users through UI navigation and other app features.
