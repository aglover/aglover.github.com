You might feel like a kid in a candy store grabbing third-party code from GitHub or another repository, but there are still some tricks to integrating it with your Android UI. This month, Andrew Glover shows you how to take the Overheard Word demo app up a level with a JSON-based word engine and some prebaked, swipe-gesture functionality. As it turns out, Android easily accommodates third-party code, but you still have to do some careful logic if you want your app's UI to run it smoothly.
