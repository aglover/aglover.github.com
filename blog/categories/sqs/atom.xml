    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://github.com/aglover/ahoy">Ahoy!</a>, which is an asynchronous <a href="http://thediscoblog.com/blog/categories/sqs/">SQS</a> adapter for <a href="http://thediscoblog.com/blog/categories/aws/">AWS's Java SQS library</a>, is now syncing with Maven Central. This means you can easily use Ahoy! in your Maven or Gradle builds.</p>

<p>For example, if you want to <a href="http://thediscoblog.com/blog/2013/09/29/ahoy-there-callbacks/">spice up your SQS</a> and you use Maven, just add the following dependency for your <code>pom.xml</code> file and you'll be rockin' it in no time, baby!</p>

<p>``` xml Including Ahoy! into your Maven pom.xml
<dependency></p>

<pre><code>&lt;groupId&gt;com.github.aglover&lt;/groupId&gt;
&lt;artifactId&gt;ahoy&lt;/artifactId&gt;
&lt;version&gt;1.0.1&lt;/version&gt;
</code></pre>

<p></dependency>
```</p>

<p>You don't use Maven? But rather use Gradle? I've got you covered!</p>

<p><code>groovy Adding Ahoy! into your Gradle build.gradle file
compile 'com.github.aglover:ahoy:1.0.1'
</code></p>

<p>Check out <a href="http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.github.aglover/ahoy">mvnrepository.com</a> for how to include Ahoy! into your SBT build or other dependency management tool like Ivy.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left" src="/images/mine/time1.jpg">When it comes to queues, whether they're implemented as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Message_Service">JMS</a>, database tables (i.e. what Ruby's <a href="http://thediscoblog.com/blog/2013/06/10/backgrounding-tasks-in-heroku-with-delayed-job/">Delayed::Job</a> uses for a queue), or even <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/sqs/">Amazon's SQS</a>, the most common metric used to evaluate the state of a queue is its length. In essence, one derives an efficiency metric based upon how many messages are residing in a queue at any given time. If there are just a few messages, the queue is operating efficiently. If there are numerous messages, things are inefficient and alarms must be sounded.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>But what if you're in a consistently busy environment with extreme bursts where queues have the tendency to rapidly fill up? If you have sufficient workers <em>already running</em> to handle that burst, do you need to fire up more?</p>

<p>You can fire up more workers, but doing so might cost you. That is, you might have to provision new worker instances, such as <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/dynos">Heroku worker dynos</a> or AWS AMIs, which will end up costing you tangible money. And sometimes those worker instances take a few moments to fire up and when they're operational, the burst of activity is over and the queue is back to normal -- the initially available workers handled the load adequately.</p>

<p>It turns out that the queue's length was a lagging indicator. You spun up unneeded resources. False alarm!</p>

<p>If you already have sufficient capacity to handle the influx of messages on a queue, then monitoring a queue's length isn't too helpful. In fact, it's a misleading metric and can cause you to take unneeded actions.</p>

<p>Consequently, a queue's length <em>is not indicative of a system's efficiency</em> when there's already sufficient workers present. Rather, the metric that means something in a high capacity environment is <em>how long a message resides in a queue</em>. That is an actionable metric: if messages are stuck in a queue waiting to be processed then you need more processors!</p>

<h2>Moo over queue length and let queue wait time in</h2>

<p>By default, <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/j-javadev2-17/">Amazon's SQS</a> doesn't provide the ability to query how long a message has been residing in a queue. Therefore, <a href="https://github.com/aglover/moo">I wrote Moo</a>.</p>

<p>Moo provides an interface for clients to obtain and take action on the message time in queue metric. This is done by augmenting an SQS message with a time stamp. That time stamp is then checked when a message is popped off of an SQS queue. If a threshold difference is exceed, then a callback is invoked.</p>

<p>Users of Moo will find its usage similar to <a href="https://github.com/aglover/ahoy">Ahoy!</a>, which is an asynchronous callback oriented facade on top of <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/sdkforjava/">AWS's Java SDK</a>. In fact, Moo uses Ahoy! underneath, with the added feature of attaching a "maximum time in queue" asynchronous callback.</p>

<p>Moo supports multiple time in queue thresholds and setting a maximum time in queue threshold is done like so:</p>

<p>``` java Adding a maximum threshold for time in queue
//adds a 1 second max threshold
sqs.addQueueWaitTimeCallback(1000, new QueueWaitTimeCallback() {
  public void onThresholdExceeded(long waitTime) {</p>

<pre><code>//waitTime is the actual time in queue
//do something... like fire off a web hook, etc
</code></pre>

<p>  }
});
```</p>

<p>Note the <code>addQueueWaitTimeCallback</code> method takes a millisecond maximum time in queue value and an accompanying <code>QueueWaitTimeCallback</code> callback implementation. The <code>onThresholdExceeded</code> method will be invoked asynchronously during a message receive if the maximum threshold value is exceeded; what's more, the <code>onThresholdExceeded</code> will receive as a parameter the actual queue wait time.</p>

<h4>Show me the Moo</h4>

<p>To fire up an instance of Moo, you have a number of options, including configuring an instance of AWS's <code>AmazonSQS</code> or just passing along a key, secret, and queue name like so:</p>

<p><code>
SQS sqs = new SQS(System.getProperty("key"), System.getProperty("secret"), System.getProperty("queue"));
</code></p>

<p>Next, you can attach zero to many <code>QueueWaitTimeCallback</code> instances like so:</p>

<p>```
sqs.addQueueWaitTimeCallback(600000, new QueueWaitTimeCallback() {
  public void onThresholdExceeded(long actualWaitTime) {</p>

<pre><code>//do something -- fire off SNS message?
</code></pre>

<p>  }
});
```</p>

<p>In this case, I've added a callback to be invoked if messages are in a queue longer than 10 minutes. Note, these <code>QueueWaitTimeCallback</code> callbacks are fired by the <em>queue reader</em> instance; accordingly, a <code>QueueWaitTimeCallback</code> can certainly fire up more instances of itself, for example.</p>

<p>Here's a sample JSON document that you might want to throw onto an SQS queue:</p>

<p>```
{ "employees":[</p>

<pre><code>  { "firstName":"John", "lastName":"Doe" },
  { "firstName":"Anna", "lastName":"Smith" },
  { "firstName":"Peter", "lastName":"Jones" }
</code></pre>

<p>]}
```</p>

<p>Sending and receiving this message are exactly like you'd do if you were using Ahoy!. For example, to send a message, just pass along a <code>String</code> to the <code>send</code> method:</p>

<p>```
sqs.send(json, new SendCallback() {
  public void onSend(String messageId) {</p>

<pre><code>//messageId is from SQS
</code></pre>

<p>  }
});
```</p>

<p>Note, the <code>send</code> method takes an optional <code>SendCallback</code>.</p>

<p>Receiving a message is via the <code>receive</code> method, which takes a mandatory <code>ReceiveCallback</code> -- this callback will be invoked asynchronously <em>for each</em> message received off of a queue. Each instance will receive the message placed upon the queue and the message's SQS id.</p>

<p>```
sqs.receive(new ReceiveCallback() {
  public void onReceive(String messageId, String message) {</p>

<pre><code>//do something w/the message -- in this case it's JSON
</code></pre>

<p>  }
});
```</p>

<p>Note, if upon the receive of a message, Moo notices that a message has been waiting in a queue for more than the max queue wait time threshold configured for an associated <code>QueueWaitTimeCallback</code>, Moo will invoke it. Note, Moo can invoke more than one instance; thus, you can set up a chain to take various actions as times increase.</p>

<p>Remember, a queue's length is usually a lagging indicator.  The metric that actually means something is how long a message resides in a queue. That's an actionable metric and <a href="https://github.com/aglover/moo">Moo</a> gives you the ability to do something about it! Can you dig it?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="right" src="/images/mine/callback.jpg">Because it's my bag, I like <a href="http://thediscoblog.com/blog/categories/javascript/">JavaScript</a>. In fact, I've grown to love JavaScritp's asynchronous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callback_(computer_programming">callback oriented style of programming</a>. Consequently, when I find myself in a non-JavaScript environment, say, like <a href="http://thediscoblog.com/blog/categories/java/">Java</a>, I tend to miss using callbacks.</p>

<p>The good news is that you can <em>emulate</em> asynchronous callbacks in Java. In fact, I did just that recently with a library I've dubbed <a href="https://github.com/aglover/ahoy">Ahoy!</a>, which is an asynchronous <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/j-javadev2-17/">SQS adapter</a> for AWS's Java <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/sqs/">SQS</a> library.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>For the uninitiated, <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/j-javadev2-17/">SQS is a cloud based messaging platform</a> -- with SQS you can create queues and put messages onto those queues, which can then be read -- later or immediately by some other process or the same exact process. All of this leverages Amazon’s massively redundant architecture to offer extremely high availability in the face of concurrent access.</p>

<p>Asynchronous callbacks in Java can be achieved with two features: anonymous classes (containing one method) and Java's <code>java.util.concurrent</code> package.</p>

<p>Because Java doesn't allow you to pass functions (or methods) <em>easily</em> as a parameter, to simulate a callback, you can create an interface that contains one method, which basically mimics a function. In the case of Ahoy, there are two interfaces: <code>MessageSendCallback</code> and <code>MessageReceivedCallback</code> -- both have one method: <code>onSend</code> and <code>onReceive</code> respectively. Accordingly, Ahoy!''s primary class, dubbed <code>SQSAdapter</code> exposes two simple methods: <code>send</code> and <code>receive</code> and both take their related callback interface.</p>

<p>The most straightforward callback to understand is the <code>receive</code> method. As you can imagine, <code>receive</code> is intended to handle behavior when a message is received off of a particular queue. Thus, the <code>receive</code> method is defined as follows:</p>

<p><code>java SQSAdapter's receive method
public void receive(final MessageReceivedCallback callback) {}
</code></p>

<p>The <code>MessageReceivedCallback</code> interface looks like this:</p>

<p>``` java The MessageReceivedCallback interface
public interface MessageReceivedCallback {</p>

<pre><code>public void onReceive(String messageId, String message);
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>Note, the <code>onReceive</code> method takes a message id (which is particular to SQS) and the message itself -- which in the case of SQS is always a <code>String</code> (that <code>String</code> can hold anything you want, keep in mind: JSON, XML, byte sequence, etc).</p>

<p>Thus, clients of Ahoy! provide the intended behavior for a message when it is received. This behavior could be to write something to a database, generate another message and send it on another queue, you name it.</p>

<p>Now the interesting part is the implementation of Ahoy!'s <code>receive</code> method. To achieve asynchronocity, I employed Java's <code>java.util.concurrent</code> package, which sadly, seems to be under appreciated.</p>

<p>``` java The receive method's implementation with callback being invoked
private void receive(final AmazonSQS sqs, final String queueURL, final MessageReceivedCallback callback) {
  pool.execute(new Runnable() {</p>

<pre><code>public void run() {
  final List&lt;Message&gt; messages = sqs.receiveMessage(
          new ReceiveMessageRequest(queueURL).withMaxNumberOfMessages(10).withWaitTimeSeconds(20)).getMessages();
  if (messages.size() &gt; 0) {
      for (final Message message : messages) {
        callback.onReceive(message.getMessageId(), message.getBody());
        sqs.deleteMessage(new DeleteMessageRequest(queueURL, message.getReceiptHandle()));
      }
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>  });
}
```</p>

<p>With a fixed Thread pool, a thread is created, which waits for messages to arrive on a particular queue; when one shows up, the passed in <code>MessageReceivedCalledback</code> is invoked for each message.</p>

<p>For an example of how this works for clients of Ahoy!, here's a test case that verifies the execution of the callback:</p>

<p>``` java The receive method implemented
final boolean[] wasReceived = {false};
ahoy.receive(new MessageReceivedCallback() {
  public void onReceive(String messageId, String message) {</p>

<pre><code>wasReceived[0] = true;
assertNotNull("message id was null", messageId);
assertEquals("message wasn't " + origMessage, origMessage, message);
</code></pre>

<p>  }
});
```</p>

<p>Likewise, sending a message is similar -- a new <code>Runnable</code> instance is created, which sends a particular message and invokes the passed in <code>MessageSentCallback</code>'s <code>onSend</code> method, passing in the newly sent messages's id.</p>

<p>``` java The send method is also asynchronous
private void send(final AmazonSQS sqs, final String queueURL, final String message, final MessageSentCallback callback) {
  pool.execute(new Runnable() {</p>

<pre><code>  public void run() {
  SendMessageResult res = sqs.sendMessage(new SendMessageRequest(queueURL, message));
  if (callback != null) {
    callback.onSend(res.getMessageId());
  }
  }
</code></pre>

<p>  });
}
```</p>

<p>Incidentally, the AWS Java SDK <em>does provide an asynchronous client</em>; however, this client's implementation leverages Java's <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/Future.html">Futures</a>. While <a href="http://nurkiewicz.blogspot.com/2013/02/javautilconcurrentfuture-basics.html">Futures are a neat concept</a>, Ahoy!'s implementation is more convenient (<em>at least for me and in the patterns of how I employ SQS</em>) than Futures as there isn't any polling involved once a message is sent or received.</p>

<p>While callbacks aren't <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_object#In_Java">necessarily supported</a> natively in Java, you can emulate them quite nicely and achieve the same level of code conciseness as what's common in JavaScript. And if you need a handy way to interface with AWS SQS, <a href="https://github.com/aglover/ahoy">then give Ahoy! a try</a>! Can you dig it, man?</p>
