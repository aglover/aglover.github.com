The fifth article in [IBM developerWorks](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/)' series [Mobile for the Masses](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/views/java/libraryview.jsp?search_by=mobile+for+the+masses) has been published! [This hip article](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/mo-mobileforthemasses5/index.html) shows you how to add a multiple-choice quiz to your Android mobile app, then sign it with a secure digital certificate.

As the article summary states:

By web logic, content is king; but for mobile users, interaction rules. Static information design is out for mobile apps, and gamification is in. This month Andrew Glover concludes his introduction to Android mobile development by adding a multiple-choice quiz feature to the example app, Overheard Word, introduced in a previous article. Then he shows you how to generate a digital signature and publish and promote your signed app on Google Play or Amazon Appstore for Android.
