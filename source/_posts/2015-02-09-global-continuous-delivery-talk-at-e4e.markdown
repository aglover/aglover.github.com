Back in September of last year, [I had the pleasure](http://www.engineers4engineers.org/speakers#glover) of giving a talk about Netflix's Continuous Delivery pipelines at [Constant Contact's 2nd annual Engineers4Engineers Conference](http://www.engineers4engineers.org/) in Waltham, MA. It's a fabulous conference and definitely worth attending if you're local to the Boston area.

My session examines the Netflix Continuous Delivery model and provides insights that you can leverage in your own Continuous Delivery processes.
