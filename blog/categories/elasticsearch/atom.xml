    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left" src="/images/mine/es-bonzai.jpg">Curious to see what all the <a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/">ElasticSearch</a> hubbub is about? Wanna see it in action without a lot of elbow grease? Then look no further, friend -- in less than 60 seconds, I'll show you how to install <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-javadev2-24/">ElasticSearch</a> on an <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">AWS AMI</a>.</p>

<p>You'll first <a href="http://www.drdobbs.com/web-development/getting-started-with-the-cloud-amazon-we/231601598">need an AWS account</a> along with an SSH key pair. If you don't already have those two steps done, go ahead and do that. The steps that follow suggest a particular AMI; however, you are free to select the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/">instance type</a>. <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-types.html">Micro instance types</a> are free to use; consequently, you can get <a href="http://thediscoblog.com/blog/2013/05/14/the-democratization-of-search/">up and running with ElasticSearch</a> in less than a minute <em>for free</em>.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Now that you've got an <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/web/library/j-s3/">AWS</a> account and an SSH key pair, go ahead and create a new security group (or edit an existing one). It's important that the <a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/tutorials/elasticsearch-on-ec2/">following ports</a> are open:</p>

<ul>
<li>22 (required for SSH)</li>
<li>80 (ElasticSearch uses HTTP for standard API calls)</li>
<li>9200 (required for ElasticSearch)</li>
<li>9300 (required for ElasticSearch)</li>
</ul>


<p>Next, fire up a Linux AMI. I, for example, prefer <a href="http://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/locator/ec2/">ami-c30360aa</a> (this is Ubuntu Server version 13.04) and I configure the AMI to use the security group that I just covered.</p>

<p>Now, SSH to your newly instantiated AMI.  Once on the AMI, you'll need to install Java. Never fear though, I've got you covered. All you need to do is run a handy script via the <a href="https://github.com/aglover/ubuntu-equip">Ubuntu-Equip project</a>, that I use frequently just for this sorta thing:</p>

<p><code>bash installing Java
wget --no-check-certificate https://github.com/aglover/ubuntu-equip/raw/master/equip_java.sh &amp;&amp; bash equip_java.sh
</code></p>

<p>You'll need to accept the license from Oracle. Once that script completes, go ahead and type  <code>java -version</code> and you should see Oracle's JDK (i.e Java version "1.7.0_21").</p>

<p>Next, download and install ElasticSearch via another nifty <a href="https://github.com/aglover/ubuntu-equip">Ubuntu-Equip</a> script:</p>

<p><code>bash installing elasticsearch
wget --no-check-certificate https://github.com/aglover/ubuntu-equip/raw/master/equip_elasticsearch.sh &amp;&amp; bash equip_elasticsearch.sh
</code></p>

<p>This script doesn't start ElasticSearch for you; thus, go ahead and change directories into the <code>elasticsearch</code> directory and fire it up like so:</p>

<p><code>bash starting elasticsearch
~/elasticsearch$ bin/elasticsearch -f
</code></p>

<p>Take a deep breath (but not too deep, as I need you to finish in less than 60 seconds) and find the Public DNS of the AMI you've been working on. Go ahead and copy it, then fire up a browser on your local machine and go to http://YOUR_AMI_DNS_NAME.com:9200/_plugin/inquisitor/ (be sure to note the port).</p>

<p>By the way, <a href="https://github.com/polyfractal/elasticsearch-inquisitor">Inquisitor</a> is a handy web application that lets you query your indexes. It was installed via the Ubuntu-Equip script -- this tool is invaluable in figuring out how to properly query your indexes.</p>

<p>And that is it. In less than 60 seconds you've got ElasticSearch running in the cloud for you. Want to create a cluster? No problem, just follow these steps again to fire up another ElasticSearch instance and then <a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/videos/three-nodes-and-one-cluster/">configure the cluster accordingly</a>.</p>

<p>I've not gone over <a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/setup/configuration/">configuring ElasticSearch</a> nor have I showed you how to create ElasticSearch as a service on a Linux instance, but for one minute, what do you expect?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="right" src="/images/mine/democracy.jpg">Over the past year and a half, I've watched <a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/">ElasticSearch</a> grow from a seemingly part-time code experiment into a thriving ecosystem. Not only has the number of <a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/clients/">client libraries</a> grown from 1 to over 25 (and counting!); it's now a <a href="http://www.elasticsearch.com/">commercially sponsored project</a> to the tune of <a href="http://www.whiteboardmag.com/youre-hot-or-not-why-elasticsearch-raised-24-million-just-3-months-after-a-10-million-round/">$34 million</a> (a <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/elasticsearch-raises-24-million-big-data-analytics-7000011496/">$10M series A</a> and a <a href="http://gigaom.com/2013/02/19/open-source-search-tool-elasticsearch-gets-24m/">$24M series B</a>) with 200,000 downloads a month.</p>

<p>Search is the touchstone of the Internet; without search the Internet wouldn't be all that useful. Google's meteoric rise and its resultant eponymous name for search is clear evidence as to the importance of search. Search, however, hasn't always been that easy nor affordable to implement.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Before the likes of open source projects like <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/">Lucene</a>, implementing search in an application involved an expensive commercial product or a series of SQL <code>like</code> statements that were never really good enough. Lucene, however, isn't a simple hobbyist's pursuit. Lucene requires a lot of expertise; what's more, successful projects within the Lucene ecosystem, like <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/solr/">Solr</a> lack a key feature that is defining modern architectures: <a href="http://www.searchblox.com/solr-vs-elasticsearch">distributed</a>.</p>

<p>The continued low cost of storage combined with cheap rent-able infrastructures like <a href="http://www.drdobbs.com/web-development/getting-started-with-the-cloud-amazon-we/231601598">AWS</a> has made it convenient to store a plethora of data, thus bringing to bear the importance that applications must support searching vast amounts of data, do it quickly, and affordably. This is where <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-javadev2-24/">ElasticSearch shines</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/overview/">ElasticSearch sits on top of Lucene</a> and adds not only a simple API for adding and searching content, but does it in a distributed manner. With infinitesimal arm grease, you can set up a search cluster that smears your data and resultant queries across a series of nodes. Not only is this resultant architecture fast, but it's easy to set up and extremely affordable as search nodes can run on commodity hardware. In essence, ElasticSearch brings search to the masses.</p>

<p>Google and its resultant ease of search has changed the mindset of application users. Searching content is a <em>presumed feature</em> and if you don't provide it, you're already a few steps behind your competition. ElasticSearch is clearly a path to constructing a viable, easy to install, affordable, distributed search infrastructure for any application. If you don't believe me, take a look at some of the innovative companies with substantial amounts of users using it: <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a>, <a href="https://foursquare.com/">foursquare</a>, and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a> are just a few.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="right" src="/images/mine/search_flickr.jpg">Search is no longer an optional feature: it's expected of most any application that consumes, produces, or stores data. And not everyone wants to be a search technology specialist, especially given the range of sophisticated algorithms underlying today's complex searches (i.e. SQL queries are no longer sufficient!). Knowing about existing, open source search platforms could save you a lot of time and money and allow you to spend your time fine-tuning your software's main functionality.</p>

<p>In "<a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-javadev2-24/index.html">Java development 2.0: Scalable searching with ElasticSearch</a>", I introduce <a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/">ElasticSearch</a>, a distributed search platform that is easy to get started with and vastly extendable. ElasticSearch's sophistication and ease-of-use are impressive, and its support for horizontal scalability offers a world of options should your data requirements need to scale. So what are you waiting for? Give <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-javadev2-24/index.html">it a read</a>!</p>
