Recently, a [buddy of mine](https://twitter.com/trianglechoke) pointed me to an interesting tweet:

New tool converts your Apple #iOS apps to #HTML5 http://dld.bz/cejxz  #appdev
{% endblockquote %}

The article about this new tool, dubbed the "[Intel HTML5 App Porter Tool](http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/technical-reference-intel-html5-app-porter-tool-beta)" suggests that because iOS apps are limited to one platform, HTML5:


{% blockquote Softtalkblog http://www.develop-online.net/news/43193/New-tool-converts-your-Apple-apps-to-HTML5 New tool converts your Apple apps to HTML5 %}
represents an opportunity because itâ€™s supported across a wide range of different devices and operating systems, so it enables the same code base to be reused across different app deployments. 
{% endblockquote %}

{% img right http://www.carinsurance.com/imagesvr_ce/6464/152631.jpg %} While technically this statement is true -- HTML5 _is ubiquitous_ and you do end up with a single code base -- HTML5 is the lowest common app development denominator and thus produces an underwhelming experience when compared to its native brethren. 

Taking a native iOS (or Android) app and recasting it into an HTML5 app is like taking your beautiful Ferrari and trading it for a station wagon. The experience will never be quite the same.

Don't get caught up in the HTML5 hype-cycle. It's a great platform for mobile web sites, but if you're building a mobile app, the UX bar has been set quite high. You cannot yet meet that bar with HTML5.
