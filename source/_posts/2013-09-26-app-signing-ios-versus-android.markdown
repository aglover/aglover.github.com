{% img left /images/mine/sealed.jpg %}Apple's app signing process can be a real pain-in-the-neck; nevertheless, it works to keep apps trusted. You know when you download a Bank of America app from iTunes that it's the real thing. You know that the app comes from _the_ Bank of America. 

On the other hand, Android allows apps to be self-signed. This has a fundamental flaw: an Android developer can claim to be anyone they want, _including Bank of America_. Thus, when you download an app from an Android App store, there's a real possibility that the app was submitted by a charlatan. What's more, those charlatan apps can actually be malicious!

[Daniel Eran Dilger](http://twitter.com/danieleran) has written an excellent article that features the differences between Apple's signing process and Google's. I highly recommend you read his article entitled "[Google's Android haunted by Steve Jobs' warnings on app signing security](http://appleinsider.com/articles/13/07/14/editorial-googles-android-haunted-by-steve-jobs-warnings-on-app-signing-security)" as it sheds a bright light on the differences between the two mobile platforms; moreover, the article does a great job of outlining the evolution of iOS and its app security policies. 

And while you are at it, check out my article entitled "[Mobile for the masses: Sign, seal, and deliver your Android app](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/mo-mobileforthemasses5/index.html)" and learn how to sign your Android app in preparation for submitting it to an app store!
