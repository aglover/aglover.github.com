{% img right /images/mine/mftm_1.jpg %}My second article in [IBM developerWorks](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/)' series [Mobile for the Masses](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/views/java/libraryview.jsp?search_by=mobile+for+the+masses) is out! [This article](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-mobileforthemasses2/index.html) covers how to go about designing a mobile interface from the standpoint of usability via gestures. In essence, eschew buttons and prefer the swipe! What's more, I cover at a high level how to test your app on an Android device. 

As the article summary states: 

{% blockquote IBM DeveloperWorks http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-mobileforthemasses2/index.html Mobile for the masses: Take a swipe at it! Programming gestures in Android %}
Mobile users are typically distracted, busy, and ergonomically constrained, so build your mobile application UIs accordingly. Andrew Glover discusses key factors that differentiate mobile apps from web apps, then guides you through the creation of a mobile application UI that uses swipe gestures for navigation rather than button clicks.
