{% img left http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/i/t-j-f-cloudpodcast_ffffff.jpg %}The good folks over at [IBM developerWorks](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/) have recently published [season 5 of the Java technical podcast series](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/j-gloverpodcast5/index.html). This season 
focuses on the technologies, companies, and people influencing cloud computing. I had the pleasure to chat with a cadre of super interesting people, including [Sacha Labourey](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/j-gloverpodcast5/index.html#labourey) of CloudBees, [Bill Platt and Mark Gaydos](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/j-gloverpodcast5/index.html#engineyard) of Engine Yard, and [Jesse Proudman](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/j-gloverpodcast5/index.html#proudman) of BlueBox, just to name a few! 

[In these podcasts](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/j-gloverpodcast5/index.html), you'll hear from people who not only influence, but directly impact cloud computing, regardless of the underlying language or platform. There's a lot to learn here, so put on your headphones and get ready for some interesting conversations! So what are you waiting for?
