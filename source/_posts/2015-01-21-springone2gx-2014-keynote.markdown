Last fall, [I had the distinct pleasure](https://2014.event.springone2gx.com/presenters/andrew_glover.html) to keynote at [Pivotal's 2014 SpringOne2GX conference](http://springone2gx.com/). My message was one of speed; that is, _speed is the killer app_. Indeed, [Spring Boot](http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) has been a breath of fresh air and a boon to development velocity. Boot is the bedrock for developmental speed on the JVM.

In fact, [a simple Boot app can fit into a tweet](https://twitter.com/rob_winch/status/364871658483351552), as [Rob Winch](https://twitter.com/rob_winch) ingeniously demonstrated in August of 2013.

As I said at the conference and still maintain: 

{% blockquote %}
Spring Boot makes it super easy and quick to make Spring-powered, production ready services without a lot of code! A Hello World app in a tweet is a radical departure from what it took 10 years ago! Out-of-the-box non-functional features like security, metrics, health-checks, embedded servers, and externalized configuration made Boot an easy choice... 
{% endblockquote %}

Check out [Spring Boot](http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/)! I think you'll be impressed.
