<p>As the article summary states:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>You might feel like a kid in a candy store grabbing third-party code from GitHub or another repository, but there are still some tricks to integrating it with your Android UI. This month, Andrew Glover shows you how to take the Overheard Word demo app up a level with a JSON-based word engine and some prebaked, swipe-gesture functionality. As it turns out, Android easily accommodates third-party code, but you still have to do some careful logic if you want your app's UI to run it smoothly.</p><footer><strong>IBM DeveloperWorks</strong> <cite><a href='http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-mobileforthemasses4/index.html'>Mobile for the Masses: Words and Gestures With Overheard Word</a></cite></footer></blockquote></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.b50.hoproll">my Android apps</a> recently suffered from a nefariously ugly UI glitch that, embarrassingly, a user reported to me.  Strangely, this phenomenon did not surface itself in local testing on either emulators or devices when I first wrote the app; nevertheless, I was able to reproduce the error after the bug report came in. I suspect that recent updates in the Android platform might have exacerbated the issue for my app as I'm fairly certain I never saw it before.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Beacon50-Hop-Roll/dp/B00A9Z5P42/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1370959609&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=hoproll">HopRoll</a> displays a ListView of hops and has a custom background like so:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/mine/hop_roll_2.png"></p>

<p>When people scrolled through that list, however, they would see a nasty black partially rendered screen that made the app completely unusable as you can see below:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/mine/hop_roll_1.png"></p>

<p>If you start to notice that your <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/ListView.html">ListView</a> containing custom backgrounds become <a href="http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2009/01/why-is-my-list-black-android.html">horribly black</a> when scrolling then you've got the same issue.</p>

<p>Luckily, it's quite easy to rectify. It turns out that when scrolling, there is some rendering magic going on that can obstruct the background in an ungainly way; you <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2833057/background-listview-becomes-black-when-scrolling">can fix it</a> by adding one line to the ListView's layout definition:</p>

<p><code>xml Adding this to your ListView Layout definition will fix the issue
android:cacheColorHint="@android:color/transparent"
</code></p>

<p>With that line in place, scrolling, once again, becomes clean and smooth.</p>

<p>You can find my app, Hop Roll, which is your go-to home brew resource for all hop related information on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.b50.hoproll">Google Play</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Beacon50-Hop-Roll/dp/B00A9Z5P42/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1370959609&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=hoproll">Amazon's Android App Store</a> -- keep on trucking, baby!</p>

<p>As the article summary states:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>The Activity class is the workhorse of an Android mobile app, and it's also where you can fine-tune your app's interactions with both the user and the mobile device. Get things working exactly the way you want them in your app's lifecycle, then use icons and action bars to guide users through UI navigation and other app features.</p><footer><strong>IBM DeveloperWorks</strong> <cite><a href='http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-mobileforthemasses3/index.html'>Mobile for the Masses: Activities and Icons in Your Android Application Lifecycle</a></cite></footer></blockquote></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left" src="/images/mine/gesticulate.png">Why bother building navigation buttons in an Android app when you can easily capture finger swipes? But, if you've ever implemented gesture section in Android there's the drudgery of implementing listeners and you also need to do some elementary Cartesian math. Save yourself the boilerplate bother mathematics and use a <a href="https://github.com/aglover/gesticulate">library</a>!</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/aglover/gesticulate">Gesticulate</a> makes it painless to detect straightforward swiping motions like up, down, left, and right. It's a simple jar file you include in your Android <code>libs</code> directory. Throw Gesticulate's <code>SwipeDetector</code> inside an instance of Android's <code>SimpleOnGestureListener</code>, for example, and you're detecting swipes with ease!</p>

<p>Gesticulate is used in Savvy Words, a flash card vocabulary app found on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.b50.savvywords">Google Play</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Beacon50-Savvy-Words/dp/B00C535D20/ref=sr_1_1?s=mobile-apps&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1365339189&amp;sr=1-1">Amazon's Appstore for Android</a>. See the <a href="https://github.com/aglover/gesticulate">Github project</a> for more details such as code examples for how to use Gesticulate, how to build it, and to see Gesticulate's tests. Swipe on, baby!</p>
