As if the JavaScript console in Chrome couldn't be any more awesome. Check it out: [Command Line API Reference](https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/commandline-api). Yep, it's legit. I've been using Firebug and the like for years and only just ran across this feature of Chrome's JavaScript console.

My favorite: `getEventListeners`. Understanding how the DOM is augmented with listeners is amazingly helpful! 

All you have to do is fire up the JavaScript Console in Chrome and in the actual console window, you have a host a commands you can execute now just like you have in any other terminal app. Very helpful!
