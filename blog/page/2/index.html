  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently, a <a href="https://twitter.com/trianglechoke">buddy of mine</a> pointed me to an interesting tweet:</p>

<blockquote><p>New tool converts your Apple #iOS apps to #HTML5 http://dld.bz/cejxz  #appdev</p><footer><strong>@effectiveui</strong> <cite><a href='https://twitter.com/effectiveui/status/299626694149537792'>twitter.com/effectiveui/status/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>The article about this new tool, dubbed the &#8221;<a href="http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/technical-reference-intel-html5-app-porter-tool-beta">Intel HTML5 App Porter Tool</a>&#8221; suggests that because iOS apps are limited to one platform, HTML5:</p>

<blockquote><p>represents an opportunity because itâ€™s supported across a wide range of different devices and operating systems, so it enables the same code base to be reused across different app deployments.</p><footer><strong>Softtalkblog</strong> <cite><a href='http://www.develop-online.net/news/43193/New-tool-converts-your-Apple-apps-to-HTML5'>New Tool Converts Your Apple Apps to HTML5</a></cite></footer></blockquote>


<p><img class="right" src="http://www.carinsurance.com/imagesvr_ce/6464/152631.jpg"> While technically this statement is true &#8211; HTML5 <em>is ubiquitous</em> and you do end up with a single code base &#8211; HTML5 is the lowest common app development denominator and thus produces an underwhelming experience when compared to its native brethren.</p>

<p>Taking a native iOS (or Android) app and recasting it into an HTML5 app is like taking your beautiful Ferrari and trading it for a station wagon. The experience will never be quite the same.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t get caught up in the HTML5 hype-cycle. It&#8217;s a great platform for mobile web sites, but if you&#8217;re building a mobile app, the UX bar has been set quite high. You cannot yet meet that bar with HTML5.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.mongodb.org/">MongoDB</a> supports a <a href="http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/applications/read/">rich query language</a>; in fact, its support of dynamic queries is one of its <a href="http://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/dw/demos/jmongodbdocs/index.html">more distinguishing features</a> compared to other datastores in the <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/d/data-management/flexing-nosql-mongodb-in-review-185922">NoSQL</a> world. Mongo&#8217;s query language has a variety of query selectors that enable you to <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/training/kp/j-kp-mongo/">fashion some powerful document searches</a>. One particular <a href="http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/operators/#element">query selector that comes in handy</a> from time to time is <code>$exists</code>.</p>

<p>Because <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-javadev2-12/">Mongo is document oriented</a> and thus lacks a rigid schema, documents (for better or for worse) can have varying structures within a collection. In practice, you probably don&#8217;t see vastly differing documents within a collection; however, from time to time, various document fields might differ (as in, <em>they might not be present</em>). Take for example, the classic example of a business card: some cards (i.e. documents) might list a fax number while others might omit it. As another example, as an application and its corresponding data evolves, new fields might be added (or removed).</p>

<p>The <code>$exists</code> query selector facilitates finding documents that have (or do not have) specific fields. On more than one occasion, I&#8217;ve employed this query selector to find documents in need of a surgical update. For example, in a collection dubbed <code>words</code> with word documents that each contain an embedded <code>definitions</code> document collection, I can find those particular definitions that do not have a <code>part_of_speech</code> element like so:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>$exists query selector in action</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class="nx">db</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">words</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">find</span><span class="p">({</span><span class="s2">&quot;definitions.part_of_speech&quot;</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="s2">&quot;$exists&quot;</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="kc">false</span><span class="p">}}).</span><span class="nx">sort</span><span class="p">({</span><span class="s2">&quot;spelling&quot;</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">}).</span><span class="nx">limit</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">100</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Note that the <code>$exists</code> query selector takes a boolean &#8211; <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>.</p>

<p>As you can probably ascertain, Mongo&#8217;s <code>$exists</code> is slightly <a href="http://www.techonthenet.com/sql/exists.php">different than SQL&#8217;s</a> <code>exists</code> &#8211; in fact, in SQL there is no way to fashion a query to find a row not containing a column! Can you dig it?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="right" src="/images/mine/search_flickr.jpg">Search is no longer an optional feature: it&#8217;s expected of most any application that consumes, produces, or stores data.

<time datetime="2012-12-21T21:19:00-05:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Dec 21<span>st</span>, 2012</time>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.app47.com/">We</a> recently implemented a new feature that required two interesting aspects: storing a file in <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/">MongoDB</a> using <a href="http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/applications/gridfs/">GridFS</a> (think traditional <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_large_object">Blob</a>) and then pushing that file down to a browser. Along the way, I discovered a lot of questions on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">stackoverflow</a> and the like pertaining to various aspects of GridFS and <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">Sinatra</a> pushes, so I thought I&#8217;d explain what we did.</p>

<p>First off, GridFS is a specification for storing and retrieving large documents. In essence, Mongo breaks a large document into smaller documents (called <em>chunks</em>) and stores them in one collection and associates the meta data related to the aggregated chunks into another collection. It&#8217;s a fairly handy feature and in our case, it made sense to use <a href="http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/faq/developers/#faq-developers-when-to-use-gridfs">GridFS</a> rather than <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3/">S3</a> (or the underlying file system).</p>

<p>All MongoDB drivers implement a similar access pattern to leverage GridFS and they hide the complexity of working with chunks. For example, <a href="https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-ruby-driver">the Ruby driver</a> simply provides a <a href="https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-ruby-driver/wiki/GridFS">single interface to manage the two GridFS collections</a>. In fact, <a href="https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-ruby-driver/blob/master/lib/mongo/gridfs/grid.rb">the interface</a> basically provides two methods: <code>get</code> &amp; <code>put</code> which might seem somewhat limiting, especially because <code>get</code> takes an <code>_id</code>! What&#8217;s more, you can add rich meta data to a GridFS document (via the <code>put</code> call) &#8211; data you&#8217;d conceivably want to query by, but at first glance, you can&#8217;t via the <code>get</code> method. Nevertheless, because GridFS is ultimately two collections in Mongo, you can query them as you would any other collection.</p>

<p>Thus, finding files by some attribute other than their <code>_id</code> is as easy as writing the corresponding query:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>GridFS example</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">file</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="vi">@mongo</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="s1">&#39;user_apks.files&#39;</span><span class="o">].</span><span class="n">find</span><span class="p">({</span><span class="ss">:filename</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="n">user_id</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">to_s</span><span class="p">})</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">first</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Keep in mind, however, that the result returned above is a JSON document &#8211; i.e. the variable <code>file</code> above isn&#8217;t a pointer to an actual I/O instance but simply a JSON document with its details. To get the actual file, use the <code>get</code> method provided by the driver&#8217;s GridFS facade &#8211; this&#8217;ll handle the details of grabbing the file from GridFS. The <code>get</code> method takes an <code>_id</code>, which you can get from the <code>file</code> document. Thus, to get an instance of a readable file, you can grab it like so:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>get via _id</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="vi">@grid</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">get</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">file</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="s1">&#39;_id&#39;</span><span class="o">]</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p></p>

<p>Thus, with the <code>get</code> call you can actually get ahold of a file instance and not some JSON document describing it.</p>

<p>To push this instance down to a browser using <a href="http://thediscoblog.com/blog/2012/12/10/sinatra-coffeescript-and-haml-swinging-in-4-steps/">Sinatra</a>, you need to do 3 things:</p>

<ul>
<li>set the content type</li>
<li>set the attachment name</li>
<li>write the file to the response</li>
</ul>


<p>In our case, the file is an <a href="http://developer.android.com/index.html">Android</a> app; accordingly, the content type is <code>application/vnd.android.package-archive</code> and as you&#8217;ll note, the attachment is simply the name of the <code>.apk</code> file. Finally, the response to the request is written to by <em>reading</em> from the corresponding GridFS file:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Sinatra push</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">get</span> <span class="s1">&#39;/some/url/:account_id/:user_id&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:agent</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="sr">/Android/</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">account_id</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">user_id</span><span class="o">|</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">file</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="c1"># get the file from GridFS</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">content_type</span> <span class="s1">&#39;application/vnd.android.package-archive&#39;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">attachment</span> <span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="n">file</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">filename</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">.apk&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">response</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">write</span> <span class="n">file</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">read</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>
As you can see, it&#8217;s all quite easy &#8211; GridFS is simply a facade for two collections; moreover, forcing a download in Sinatra is three straightforward steps. Can you dig it, man?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently decided to ditch plain old JavaScript in a <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">Sinatra</a> based application in favor of <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a>. The existing JavaScript wasn&#8217;t terribly complex; however, I was looking at having to add some AJAX based long polling and I couldn&#8217;t bring myself to do it in <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-javadev2-18/index.html">JavaScript</a>. Accordingly, I decided I&#8217;d use <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/web/library/j-coffeescript/index.html">CoffeeScript</a>, but, as it turns out, there were a few steps I had to put in place before I could enjoy some significant whitespace delimitation.</p>

<p>First, I installed <a href="https://github.com/Sutto/barista">Barista</a>, which is a nifty Ruby gem that adds transparent CoffeeScript support to any Rack app. There were a few other gems available, however, I decided that Barista had the most mature documentation and the project still showed signs of life.</p>

<p>Once I added the Barista gem to my Gemfile and ran <a href="http://gembundler.com/">Bundler</a>, I next had to require Barista in my Sinatra app; moreover, I had to register the Barista extension via <code>Sinatra.register Barista::Integration::Sinatra</code>. Note, that these steps need to be done after <a href="http://haml.info/">Haml</a> is loaded.</p>

<p>In order for Barista to work properly, you&#8217;ll need to have a JavaScript runtime handy &#8211; there are a number of options here, including <a href="https://github.com/cowboyd/therubyracer">therubyracer</a>; however, after a bit of research, I found some <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6282307/execjs-and-could-not-find-a-javascript-runtime">concerning notes regarding therubyracer&#8217;s memory consumption</a>. After a bit of surfing, I happened upon <a href="https://github.com/sstephenson/execjs">ExecJS</a>, which states that Node will work just fine. Yeah!</p>

<p>Accordingly, since this application runs on Ubuntu, I got to use a nifty script that I happened to have written about a year ago: <a href="https://github.com/aglover/ubuntu-equip">Ubuntu Equip</a>. In less than a minute, I had the latest and greatest version of Node running by running the command:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>script for install Node on Ubuntu</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>wget --no-check-certificate https://github.com/aglover/ubuntu-equip/raw/master/equip_node.sh <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> bash equip_node.sh
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Take note: this script sets a custom <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Packaging_Tool">apt-get</a> repository; otherwise, if you don&#8217;t add this repository, you&#8217;ll end up with an ancient version of Node.</p>

<p>Finally, to actually start coding in CoffeeScript, all you have to do is use Haml&#8217;s handy inline <code>:coffeescript</code> filter:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>CoffeeScript spinner</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class="o">:</span><span class="nx">coffeescript</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nx">$</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">document</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">ready</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nx">opts</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="nx">lines</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="mi">13</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">...}</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nx">spinner</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nx">Spinner</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">opts</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">spin</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">document</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">getElementById</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;spinner&#39;</span><span class="p">))</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p></p>

<p>That&#8217;s it! The steps required to get Sinatra, CoffeeScript, and Haml playing together are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Install Barista</li>
<li>Configure Sinatra</li>
<li>Install a JavaScript runtime engine</li>
<li>Write some CoffeeScript</li>
</ul>


<p>In short, Barista and <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-nodejs/">Node</a> make Sinatra swing with CoffeeScript.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/parmyolson/2012/12/04/5-eye-opening-stats-that-show-the-world-is-going-mobile/">no shortage</a> of <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/connieguglielmo/2012/12/04/mary-meekers-must-read-interent-trends-report-says-android-phone-uptake-bests-apple/">mobile growth</a> statistics, but here&#8217;s a few specific ones paint an overall picture of mobility:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.digitalbuzzblog.com/infographic-2012-mobile-growth-statistics/">Roughly 87% of the worlds population has a mobile device</a></li>
<li>Earlier this year, <a href="http://readwrite.com/2012/07/05/top-trends-of-2012-the-continuing-rapid-growth-of-mobile">Facebook claimed an astounding 488 million</a> mobile <a href="http://thediscoblog.com/blog/2012/11/28/the-essence-of-mobile-app-performance/">monthly active users </a></li>
<li>Android&#8217;s user base is growing by <a href="http://www.digitalbuzzblog.com/infographic-2012-mobile-growth-statistics/">700,000 subscribers a day</a></li>
</ul>


<p>These three facts clearly point out that mobility is a growing, global phenomenon, and that it&#8217;s drastically changing how people use the Internet. What&#8217;s more, from a technology standpoint, mobile is where the growth is!</p>

<p>But the mobile landscape is as varied as it is big. Unlike a few short years ago, when doing mobile work implied J2ME on a Blackberry, mobile development now encompasses <a href="http://www.android.com/">Android</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS">iOS</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5">HTML5</a>, and even <a href="http://dev.windowsphone.com/en-us">Windows Phone</a>. That&#8217;s 4 distinct platforms with different development platforms and languages &#8211; and I haven&#8217;t even mentioned the <a href="http://thediscoblog.com/blog/2012/09/01/cost-and-the-great-mobile-app-debate/">myriad hybrid options</a> available!</p>

<p>The key to understanding the mobile landscape is an appreciation for the various developmental platforms &#8211; their strengths &amp; weaknesses, speed of development, distribution, and, if you are looking at the consumer market, their payout.</p>

<h5>Android</h5>

<p>Android device distribution, as I pointed out earlier, is growing faster than other platforms, and the Android ecosystem has more than one app store: <a href="https://play.google.com/store?hl=en">Google Play</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/mobile-apps/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=2350149011">Amazon&#8217;s store</a>, just to name the two most popular ones. And by most accounts, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/06/27/google-play-hits-600000-apps/">Google Play has as many</a> or <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-1035_3-57521252-94/can-apples-app-store-maintain-its-lead-over-google-play/">more apps</a> than Apple&#8217;s App Store (careful with this statistic though, see details below regarding <em>payouts</em>).</p>

<p>The massive adoption of Android, however, has lead to <a href="http://opensignal.com/reports/fragmentation.php">fragmentation</a>, which does present some significant challenges with respect to testing. In fact, the reality for most developers is that it is almost impossible to test an app on all combinations of device-OS version profiles in a cost effective manner (this is a growing service industry, by the way).</p>

<p>On a positive note, Java, the native language of Android apps, is a fairly ubiquitous language &#8211; some estimates <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_%28programming_language%29">peg as many as 10 million active developers</a> so there&#8217;s no shortage of able-bodied Java developers and their associated tools out there.</p>

<p>Thus, with Android, you have a wide audience (both people with Android devices and developers to build apps) and multiple distribution channels. Yet, this large distribution of disparate devices does present some testing challenges; what&#8217;s more, it can be more difficult to make money on the Android platform compared to iOS, as you&#8217;ll see next.</p>

<h5>iOS</h5>

<p>iOS, the OS for iPhones and iPads, has a <a href="http://mobile.tutsplus.com/tutorials/iphone/understanding-the-ios-ecosystem/">tight ecosystem</a> and an avid user base, <a href="http://www.androidauthority.com/are-iphone-users-richer-better-educated-than-android-users-105032/">willing to spend money</a>, ultimately translating into <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/darcytravlos/2012/08/22/five-reasons-why-google-android-versus-apple-ios-market-share-numbers-dont-matter/">more money for developers</a>. That is, even though there are far more Android devices globally than iOS ones, the iTunes App Store generates more money than Google Play, which means more money for developers of popular apps. In many respects, users of iOS devices are also more willing to pay a fee for an app as opposed to Android ones.</p>

<p>The development ecosystem for iOS has a higher barrier to entry when compared to something like Java or JavaScript. OSX is a requirement and the <a href="http://store.apple.com/us/browse/home/shop_mac/family/macbook_pro">cost alone</a> here can be a barrier for a lot of developers; moreover, Objective-C can present some challenges for the faint of heart (manual memory management!). Yet, the tooling provided by Apple is almost universally lauded by the community at large (much like Microsoft&#8217;s VisualStudio) &#8211; <a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/">XCode</a> is a slick development tool.</p>

<p>While there isn&#8217;t a lot of device <a href="http://bgr.com/2012/06/12/apple-ios-fragmentation-iphone/">fragmentation on iOS</a>, developers do have to deal with OS fragmentation. That is, there are only a handful of Apple devices but quite a lot of different versions living in the field at any given time due to a lagging factor of user upgrades.</p>

<p>The iOS platform certainly offers a direct path to revenue, provided you can build a stellar app; however, compared to Android, this is a closed community, which has the tendency to rub some portion of developmental community wrong. Given you can quickly embrace Objective-C and afford the requisite software, iOS is almost always the first platform app developers target.</p>

<h5>HTML5</h5>

<p>HTML5 is truly universal and its apps are available on all platforms without any need to port them &#8211; JavaScript is as ubiquitous as Java; what&#8217;s more, HTML itself has almost no barrier to entry, making HTML5 and JavaScript a force to content with when it comes to finding talented developers and mass distribution. Cost isn&#8217;t even really part of the HTML5 equation too &#8211; tools and frameworks are free.</p>

<p>Yet, HTML5 apps suffer from a <a href="http://thediscoblog.com/blog/2012/09/07/past-performance-is-no-guarantee-of-future-results/">distribution challenge</a> &#8211; the major app stores do not carry these apps! Thus, in large part, as an HTML5 app developer, you are relying on a user to type in your URL into a browser. I for one, almost never type in a URL on my iPhone (while I will on my iPad). Lastly, <a href="http://thediscoblog.com/blog/2012/09/25/modevtablet-2012-video-mobile-web-realities/">HTML5 is no where near parity with respect to UX</a> compared to native apps (and may <em>never be</em>). This, however, is only a disadvantage if you are building an app that requires a strong UX. There are plenty of great HTML5 apps out there!</p>

<p>HTML5 offers an extremely low developmental barrier to entry and the widest support available &#8211; all smart devices have browsers (note, <a href="http://thediscoblog.com/blog/2012/09/24/a-tale-of-three-browsers/">they aren&#8217;t all created equal</a>!); however, because there isn&#8217;t a viable distribution channel, these apps have limited opportunity to make money.</p>

<h5>Windows Phone</h5>

<p>Windows is <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/ericsavitz/2012/12/04/microsoft-dec-qtr-surface-sales-below-1m-units-analyst-says/">still unproven</a> but could be an opportunity to get in early &#8211; first movers in Apple&#8217;s App Store without a doubt made far more money than if they had submitted the same apps today. In this case, you if want a truly native experience you&#8217;ll build apps on the .NET platform (presumably C#). Windows machines are far cheaper than OSX ones, so there is little financial barrier other than license fees for VisualStudio and a developer fee for the Windows Phone Marketplace.</p>

<p>Indeed, it appears that Microsoft is <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store">modeling their app store</a> and corresponding policies off of Apple&#8217;s &#8211; thus there is a <a href="http://www.inquisitr.com/423599/windows-phone-8-app-downloads-improve-by-100/">tightly managed distribution channel</a>, presenting an opportunity to reach a wide audience and earn their money. But, at this point, the wide audience has yet to develop.</p>

<h5>That&#8217;s 4, but there&#8217;s still more!</h5>

<p>As I alluded to in the beginning of this post, there are 4 <em>primary platforms</em> and myriad hybrid options, such as <a href="http://phonegap.com/">PhoneGap</a> and <a href="http://www.appcelerator.com/">Appcelerator</a>, for example. These hybrid options have various advantages and disadvantages; however, the primary concerns one needs to think through are still speed of development, distribution, and payout.</p>

<p>Before you embark on a mobile development effort, it pays to have the end in mind &#8211; that is, before you code, have tangible answers for app distribution, development effort, and potential payout as these points will help guide you through the mobile landscape.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="right" src="/images/mine/binoculars.png">Are you pumped that you just published an app? Yep, me too. But guess what? Once you&#8217;ve built, tested, and deployed a mobile app, you&#8217;ll find yourself concerned with two factors:</p>

<ul>
<li>visibility</li>
<li>engagement</li>
</ul>


<p>The view app stores like <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/">iTunes</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store?hl=en">Google Play</a> provide for you regarding app usage is fairly blurry. Downloads, the metric you get for free, doesn&#8217;t really tell you anything about how your app is being used.</p>

<p>While, at this point, there are essentially two platforms (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS">iOS</a> &amp; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system">Android</a>)), it&#8217;s a big big world out there with a <a href="http://www.androidpit.com/mobile-world-congress">ton of different devices</a>! What&#8217;s more, these devices, whether <a href="http://bgr.com/2012/05/16/android-fragmentation-visualized-opensignalmaps/">Android</a> <em>or <a href="http://bgr.com/2012/06/12/apple-ios-fragmentation-iphone/">iOS</a></em> are fragmented, which means your app will behave in some manner you haven&#8217;t tested. Plus, the spectrum of varied users almost guarantees they are going to do something with your app that you&#8217;ve never even considered.  In an app world, you can&#8217;t assume who will use your app!</p>

<p>When&#8217;s the last time you downloaded an app that has a measly one or two star rating? Me, neither. Once your app is live, you&#8217;ll want to know what&#8217;s happening. You&#8217;ll want to know how your app is behaving and you&#8217;ll want to know as quickly as possible before a landslide of negative feedback.</p>

<p>Behavior can be ascertained in two ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>logging</li>
<li>events</li>
</ul>


<p>Logging is a no-brainer &#8211; but remember, crash logs are not enough sometimes! While you can get these in some form or another from app stores, oftentimes monitoring error and/or warning logs can bring to light that future crash. On that same note, don&#8217;t over log either &#8211; the loquacious logger usually ends up being a nuisance by flooding you with too much information. Think <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal-to-noise_ratio">signal-to-noise</a> ratio here.</p>

<p>Events are like log messages, but they&#8217;re more typed &#8211; rather than describing geek-speak information like a JSON parsing warning at line 43, they capture succinct actions like a button click, a picture taken, a video download. The sky&#8217;s the limit when it comes to what behavior you wish to capture with an event!</p>

<p>Events come in a lot of flavors &#8211; they can have a timer associated with them and, in some respects, they can also be categorized as a session. Either which way you spin it though, events tell you <em>how your app is being used</em>. Combine these tools with dimension data like device information and geo-location and you start to see what&#8217;s happening with your app in real time &#8211; your view is certainly less cloudy!</p>

<p>Another question: are you giving your app away for free <em>without any monetization strategy</em>?  I didn&#8217;t think so. You wouldn&#8217;t have read this far otherwise. <a href="http://www.insidefacebook.com/2009/01/12/application-insights-how-exactly-is-mau-calculated/">Engagement</a> is about understanding the lifetime value of a user. You want some sort of return on your investment (and if it isn&#8217;t money, then it is certainly engaged eyeballs), otherwise you wasted your time building the app.</p>

<p>When&#8217;s the last time you downloaded an app, launched it, decided it was terrible and uninstalled it immediately? Yeah, me too (it happened while I was writing this post). I recently spoke with a government agency that disclosed to me that they had over 500,000 downloads of their app. That&#8217;s great news! Unfortunately, they had no idea if the app was being used. I bet the app I just deleted is happy they had another download too.</p>

<p>What everyone wants to know, in addition to <em>how</em> their app is being used, is <em>whether it is being used at all</em>. Are people engaged in actively using your app or do they <a href="http://www.nuance.com/ucmprod/groups/enterprise/@web-enus/documents/collateral/nc_020218.pdf">abandon</a> it? A telling metric here is <em>active users</em> &#8211; this accurately discloses how often someone uses your app. And if your monetization strategy relies on ads, for example, this metric means everything to you.</p>

<p>Just like with visibility, if you add dimension data like device information, geo-location, and even duration, a fairly vivid picture of user engagement is painted for you. You can ascertain if your app is actually delivering value.</p>

<p>Building, testing, and deploying your app is no easy feat. Congrats on getting that far! But don&#8217;t forget about what happens after that effort finishes. Putting an app out into the wild without some sort of monitoring is like driving your car from the back seat while sitting backwards. All you see is outdated and you have no view as to where you&#8217;re headed.  Visibility and engagement. If they don&#8217;t matter to you now, they will.</p>

<time datetime="2012-11-02T16:30:00-04:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Nov 2<span>nd</span>, 2012</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Over the past decade of finding myself staring at innumerable Ant build files containing a <a href="http://ant.apache.org/manual/Tasks/junit.html">JUnit task</a>, I&#8217;ve come to realize a subtle, yet powerful flag, that when not set properly, almost always leads to random and confusing test catastrophes. The JUnit task supports a number of attributes, but the most important is the <code>fork</code> one. This flag controls whether or not the tests being run are invoked within the same JVM instance of Ant itself or within a new one. By default, this value is set to <code>off</code> (<code>false</code> seems to do the same thing); however, in doing so, I&#8217;ve, from time to time, seen class loading issues or mysterious versions of jars causing strange code to be executed.</p>

<p>Thus, unless there is some reason <em>not</em> to do so, I usually set the the <code>fork</code> attribute to <code>true</code>. But alas, the story doesn&#8217;t end there! With the value of <code>true</code>, a test suite will be executed within a new JVM, shielded from Ant and 98.72% of the time, this is good enough. Nevertheless, if your code does something <em>really</em> interesting, like augment normal Java code with <a href="http://groovy.codehaus.org/Per-Instance+MetaClass">MetaClass wizardry</a> you might find yourself scratching your head, especially if you change the behavior of the same classes between tests.</p>

<p>For instance, at <a href="http://www.app47.com/">App47</a> we have a number of different software components, written in various languages, that interact via queues. In one particular case, we have a <a href="https://cirrus.app47.com">Rails</a> instance dropping messages on two queues that are ultimately processed by a Java application. The underlying queue implementation changes based upon where the code is running (i.e. in the cloud or within a data center). The data center queuing implementation was added after an initial cloud implementation was written an deployed. In order for the Java application to interact with the underlying queues and their differing implementations, at runtime, one class is dynamically augmented with some extra code, unique to the particular queue it is set to interact with. This magic is actually quite simple and is achieved via Groovy.</p>

<p>Essentially, a <code>Message</code> class (representing a generic message residing on a queue) is dynamically augmented with a <code>Processor</code> class that knows how to actually handle the message instance. In this case, we only have two types of messages, so at run time, when the actual Java process fires up, it is told which type of <code>Processor</code> to shove into a popped <code>Message</code> instance like so:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Groovy MetaClass wizardry</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='java'><span class='line'><span class="n">def</span> <span class="n">iprocessor</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">manufactureProcessor</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">processor</span><span class="o">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">iprocessor</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">setProperties</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">properties</span><span class="o">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">Message</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">metaClass</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">static</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getMessageProcessor</span> <span class="o">&lt;&lt;</span> <span class="o">{</span> <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">iprocessor</span> <span class="o">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Thus, when a particular <code>Message</code> instance is popped off of a queue, it asks itself for an instance of a <code>Processor</code> via the <code>getMessageProcessor</code> method and it proceeded to process itself. Without delving into the particulars of underlying queues or workflow, the relevant details here are that the original message was created via a Ruby process and that ultimately the underlying message is a JSON document; what&#8217;s more, the dynamic code was added to retro fit a newer queueing technology required for data center deployments.</p>

<p>Now back to JUnit and Ant: this varying and dynamic altering of a Java class caused some subtle test failures when run in a forked mode.  It turns out that in addition to the ability to fork the JVM for a test suite, you can control the granularity of how often you can fork. That is, via the <code>forkmode</code> attribute, you can fork one time for all tests or once for <em>each test</em>.</p>

<p>The <code>forkmode</code> attribute can take the values of <code>perTest</code> (which is the default value), <code>once</code>, and <code>perBatch</code> &#8211; in our particular case, the value was initially set to <code>once</code>, which meant that once a <code>Message</code> class was dynamically set with a <code>Processor</code>, it seemingly always had the <em>same one</em>. That is, even in later tests where the underlying logic was setting different <code>Processor</code> instances, they were subsequently ignored in favor of which ever <code>Processor</code> was initially set.  Switching the <code>forkmode</code> attribute to <code>perTest</code> naturally fixed the test failures. This made total sense: each JVM instance for each test had the correctly modified <code>Message</code> class. This incidentally also models how the underlying Java processes work in a production environment: they each have their own JVM.</p>

<p>Therefore, pay particular attention to the settings in an Ant file&#8217;s JUnit task. The same is true for Maven&#8217;s <a href="http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-surefire-plugin/">Surefire Plugin</a> &#8211; in both cases, the fork mode and the frequency at which tests fork can mean the difference between a successful test suite run or a cacophony of failures.</p>
