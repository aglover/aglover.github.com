    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left" src="/images/mine/es-bonzai.jpg">Curious to see what all the <a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/">ElasticSearch</a> hubbub is about? Wanna see it in action without a lot of elbow grease? Then look no further, friend -- in less than 60 seconds, I'll show you how to install <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-javadev2-24/">ElasticSearch</a> on an <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">AWS AMI</a>.</p>

<p>You'll first <a href="http://www.drdobbs.com/web-development/getting-started-with-the-cloud-amazon-we/231601598">need an AWS account</a> along with an SSH key pair. If you don't already have those two steps done, go ahead and do that. The steps that follow suggest a particular AMI; however, you are free to select the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/">instance type</a>. <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-types.html">Micro instance types</a> are free to use; consequently, you can get <a href="http://thediscoblog.com/blog/2013/05/14/the-democratization-of-search/">up and running with ElasticSearch</a> in less than a minute <em>for free</em>.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Now that you've got an <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/web/library/j-s3/">AWS</a> account and an SSH key pair, go ahead and create a new security group (or edit an existing one). It's important that the <a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/tutorials/elasticsearch-on-ec2/">following ports</a> are open:</p>

<ul>
<li>22 (required for SSH)</li>
<li>80 (ElasticSearch uses HTTP for standard API calls)</li>
<li>9200 (required for ElasticSearch)</li>
<li>9300 (required for ElasticSearch)</li>
</ul>


<p>Next, fire up a Linux AMI. I, for example, prefer <a href="http://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/locator/ec2/">ami-c30360aa</a> (this is Ubuntu Server version 13.04) and I configure the AMI to use the security group that I just covered.</p>

<p>Now, SSH to your newly instantiated AMI.  Once on the AMI, you'll need to install Java. Never fear though, I've got you covered. All you need to do is run a handy script via the <a href="https://github.com/aglover/ubuntu-equip">Ubuntu-Equip project</a>, that I use frequently just for this sorta thing:</p>

<p><code>bash installing Java
wget --no-check-certificate https://github.com/aglover/ubuntu-equip/raw/master/equip_java.sh &amp;&amp; bash equip_java.sh
</code></p>

<p>You'll need to accept the license from Oracle. Once that script completes, go ahead and type  <code>java -version</code> and you should see Oracle's JDK (i.e Java version "1.7.0_21").</p>

<p>Next, download and install ElasticSearch via another nifty <a href="https://github.com/aglover/ubuntu-equip">Ubuntu-Equip</a> script:</p>

<p><code>bash installing elasticsearch
wget --no-check-certificate https://github.com/aglover/ubuntu-equip/raw/master/equip_elasticsearch.sh &amp;&amp; bash equip_elasticsearch.sh
</code></p>

<p>This script doesn't start ElasticSearch for you; thus, go ahead and change directories into the <code>elasticsearch</code> directory and fire it up like so:</p>

<p><code>bash starting elasticsearch
~/elasticsearch$ bin/elasticsearch -f
</code></p>

<p>Take a deep breath (but not too deep, as I need you to finish in less than 60 seconds) and find the Public DNS of the AMI you've been working on. Go ahead and copy it, then fire up a browser on your local machine and go to http://YOUR_AMI_DNS_NAME.com:9200/_plugin/inquisitor/ (be sure to note the port).</p>

<p>By the way, <a href="https://github.com/polyfractal/elasticsearch-inquisitor">Inquisitor</a> is a handy web application that lets you query your indexes. It was installed via the Ubuntu-Equip script -- this tool is invaluable in figuring out how to properly query your indexes.</p>

<p>And that is it. In less than 60 seconds you've got ElasticSearch running in the cloud for you. Want to create a cluster? No problem, just follow these steps again to fire up another ElasticSearch instance and then <a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/videos/three-nodes-and-one-cluster/">configure the cluster accordingly</a>.</p>

<p>I've not gone over <a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/setup/configuration/">configuring ElasticSearch</a> nor have I showed you how to create ElasticSearch as a service on a Linux instance, but for one minute, what do you expect?</p>
