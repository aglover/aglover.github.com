    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently found myself searching <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stackoverflow</a> and Google for various techniques for automatically testing <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/migrations.html">Rails migrations</a>. I was surprised not to have found <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6079016/how-do-i-test-rails-migrations">too much</a> information though. While testing a migration is fairly straightforward (migrations are classes and you can easily invoke corresponding methods); the challenge can be setting models up properly. That is, migrations are a tool to update an underlying database to reflect changes in models -- by the time you are writing a migration, the models <em>already</em> reflect what should be.</p>

<p>Accordingly, to test a migration, you need to set up your test with how things were and then run your migration and verify things have migrated.  As it turns out, this is super easy to do with a document oriented database like <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/">MongoDB</a>. For this particular project, we're using <a href="http://mongoid.org/en/mongoid/index.html">Mongoid</a>,  which is an Object-Document-Mapper (or ODM) for MongoDB and we're also using a nifty gem dubbed <a href="https://github.com/adacosta/mongoid_rails_migrations">mongoid_rails_migrations</a>, which facilitates writing Mongoid migrations.</p>

<p>In order to reflect the state of the underlying datastore before running a migration, I needed to remove a particular collection, which due to changes in our models, is automatically populated with meta data when various events occur (think <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_trigger">relational trigger</a> here, for example). As you can probably see, as this new collection doesn't exist in production, all the existing data in production needs some corresponding default meta data to reflect the new requirements which brought this collection to life.</p>

<p>Accordingly, once I initialize my models and the corresponding collection is populated, I need to completely <a href="http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/method/db.collection.drop/">drop the collection</a>. Then, I can run my migration and then verify that the previously nuked collection is present with all the required data.</p>

<p>In my case, I'm using <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/shoulda">shoulda</a> in concert with <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-1.9.3/libdoc/test/unit/rdoc/Test/Unit.html">Test::Unit</a>, but the details of a test framework really don't matter -- in any case, you'll need to load your migration, which can be done via a <code>require</code> statement like so:</p>

<p><code>ruby Requiring a migration
require File.join(Rails.root, 'db', 'migrate', '20130217194234_member_app_roles_permissions')
</code></p>

<p>In my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_fixture">fixture</a> logic, I've initialized a few objects and related them, which automatically creates the aforementioned meta data collection; consequently, I need to do two things. First, get a connection to the underlying test datastore and then drop that collection.</p>

<p><code>ruby Obtaining a connection and dropping a collection
db = @account.db
db['member_app_roles'].drop
</code></p>

<p>Now I'm ready to run my migration -- it's as simple as invoking the <a href="http://www.railstips.org/blog/archives/2009/05/11/class-and-instance-methods-in-ruby/">class method</a> <code>up</code>!</p>

<p><code>ruby Invoking a migration
MemberAppRolesPermissions.up
</code></p>

<p>Once the migration has finished running, I can then verify that everything is cool and copasetic. In this case, I need to go directly to the datastore because those objects in memory won't reflect my changes just yet.</p>

<p>``` ruby Asserting things worked!
member = Member.find(member.id)</p>

<p>assert_equal 2, member.member_app_roles.size
member.member_app_roles.each do |app_role|
  assert_equal 'admin', app_role.role
  assert_equal member, app_role.member
  assert_not_nil app_role.app
end
```</p>

<p>As a benefit of thinking through how to test a migration, you end up unveiling how you'd construct the migration's <code>down</code> method. That is, in my case, to roll back, all I need to do is blow away the <code>member_app_roles</code> collection!</p>

<p>As you can see, testing migrations isn't terribly difficult (probably a good reason why I haven't found too much information about it); the key aspect is the logic that is applied to verify your migration actually worked. It should be noted that while I executed this test in the context of a document oriented database, you could certainly do the same in a relational database. For example, by dropping  columns, tables, etc before running a migration. Either way, testing a migration is a snap. Can you dig it?</p>

    <link href="http://aglover.github.com/blog/2012/12/21/pushing-mongo-gridfs-files-with-sinatra/"/>
    <updated>2012-12-21T21:19:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://aglover.github.com/blog/2012/12/21/pushing-mongo-gridfs-files-with-sinatra</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.app47.com/">We</a> recently implemented a new feature that required two interesting aspects: storing a file in <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/">MongoDB</a> using <a href="http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/applications/gridfs/">GridFS</a> (think traditional <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_large_object">Blob</a>) and then pushing that file down to a browser. Along the way, I discovered a lot of questions on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">stackoverflow</a> and the like pertaining to various aspects of GridFS and <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">Sinatra</a> pushes, so I thought I'd explain what we did.</p>

<p>First off, GridFS is a specification for storing and retrieving large documents. In essence, Mongo breaks a large document into smaller documents (called <em>chunks</em>) and stores them in one collection and associates the meta data related to the aggregated chunks into another collection. It's a fairly handy feature and in our case, it made sense to use <a href="http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/faq/developers/#faq-developers-when-to-use-gridfs">GridFS</a> rather than <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3/">S3</a> (or the underlying file system).</p>

<p>All MongoDB drivers implement a similar access pattern to leverage GridFS and they hide the complexity of working with chunks. For example, <a href="https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-ruby-driver">the Ruby driver</a> simply provides a <a href="https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-ruby-driver/wiki/GridFS">single interface to manage the two GridFS collections</a>. In fact, <a href="https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-ruby-driver/blob/master/lib/mongo/gridfs/grid.rb">the interface</a> basically provides two methods: <code>get</code> &amp; <code>put</code> which might seem somewhat limiting, especially because <code>get</code> takes an <code>_id</code>! What's more, you can add rich meta data to a GridFS document (via the <code>put</code> call) -- data you'd conceivably want to query by, but at first glance, you can't via the <code>get</code> method. Nevertheless, because GridFS is ultimately two collections in Mongo, you can query them as you would any other collection.</p>

<p>Thus, finding files by some attribute other than their <code>_id</code> is as easy as writing the corresponding query:</p>

<p><code>ruby GridFS example
file = @mongo['user_apks.files'].find({:filename =&gt; user_id.to_s}).first
</code></p>

<p>Keep in mind, however, that the result returned above is a JSON document -- i.e. the variable <code>file</code> above isn't a pointer to an actual I/O instance but simply a JSON document with its details. To get the actual file, use the <code>get</code> method provided by the driver's GridFS facade -- this'll handle the details of grabbing the file from GridFS. The <code>get</code> method takes an <code>_id</code>, which you can get from the <code>file</code> document. Thus, to get an instance of a readable file, you can grab it like so:</p>

<p><code>ruby get via _id
@grid.get(file['_id'])
</code></p>

<p>Thus, with the <code>get</code> call you can actually get ahold of a file instance and not some JSON document describing it.</p>

<p>To push this instance down to a browser using <a href="http://thediscoblog.com/blog/2012/12/10/sinatra-coffeescript-and-haml-swinging-in-4-steps/">Sinatra</a>, you need to do 3 things:</p>

<ul>
<li>set the content type</li>
<li>set the attachment name</li>
<li>write the file to the response</li>
</ul>


<p>In our case, the file is an <a href="http://developer.android.com/index.html">Android</a> app; accordingly, the content type is <code>application/vnd.android.package-archive</code> and as you'll note, the attachment is simply the name of the <code>.apk</code> file. Finally, the response to the request is written to by <em>reading</em> from the corresponding GridFS file:</p>

<p><code>ruby Sinatra push
get '/some/url/:account_id/:user_id', :agent =&gt; /Android/ do |account_id, user_id|
  file = # get the file from GridFS
  content_type 'application/vnd.android.package-archive'
  attachment "#{file.filename}.apk"
  response.write file.read
end
</code>
As you can see, it's all quite easy -- GridFS is simply a facade for two collections; moreover, forcing a download in Sinatra is three straightforward steps. Can you dig it, man?</p>

    <link href="http://aglover.github.com/blog/2012/12/10/sinatra-coffeescript-and-haml-swinging-in-4-steps/"/>
    <updated>2012-12-10T21:49:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://aglover.github.com/blog/2012/12/10/sinatra-coffeescript-and-haml-swinging-in-4-steps</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently decided to ditch plain old JavaScript in a <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">Sinatra</a> based application in favor of <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a>. The existing JavaScript wasn't terribly complex; however, I was looking at having to add some AJAX based long polling and I couldn't bring myself to do it in <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-javadev2-18/index.html">JavaScript</a>. Accordingly, I decided I'd use <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/web/library/j-coffeescript/index.html">CoffeeScript</a>, but, as it turns out, there were a few steps I had to put in place before I could enjoy some significant whitespace delimitation.</p>

<p>First, I installed <a href="https://github.com/Sutto/barista">Barista</a>, which is a nifty Ruby gem that adds transparent CoffeeScript support to any Rack app. There were a few other gems available, however, I decided that Barista had the most mature documentation and the project still showed signs of life.</p>

<p>Once I added the Barista gem to my Gemfile and ran <a href="http://gembundler.com/">Bundler</a>, I next had to require Barista in my Sinatra app; moreover, I had to register the Barista extension via <code>Sinatra.register Barista::Integration::Sinatra</code>. Note, that these steps need to be done after <a href="http://haml.info/">Haml</a> is loaded.</p>

<p>In order for Barista to work properly, you'll need to have a JavaScript runtime handy -- there are a number of options here, including <a href="https://github.com/cowboyd/therubyracer">therubyracer</a>; however, after a bit of research, I found some <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6282307/execjs-and-could-not-find-a-javascript-runtime">concerning notes regarding therubyracer's memory consumption</a>. After a bit of surfing, I happened upon <a href="https://github.com/sstephenson/execjs">ExecJS</a>, which states that Node will work just fine. Yeah!</p>

<p>Accordingly, since this application runs on Ubuntu, I got to use a nifty script that I happened to have written about a year ago: <a href="https://github.com/aglover/ubuntu-equip">Ubuntu Equip</a>. In less than a minute, I had the latest and greatest version of Node running by running the command:</p>

<p><code>bash script for install Node on Ubuntu
wget --no-check-certificate https://github.com/aglover/ubuntu-equip/raw/master/equip_node.sh &amp;&amp; bash equip_node.sh
</code></p>

<p>Take note: this script sets a custom <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Packaging_Tool">apt-get</a> repository; otherwise, if you don't add this repository, you'll end up with an ancient version of Node.</p>

<p>Finally, to actually start coding in CoffeeScript, all you have to do is use Haml's handy inline <code>:coffeescript</code> filter:</p>

<p>``` javascript CoffeeScript spinner
:coffeescript
  $(document).ready -></p>

<pre><code>opts = { lines: 13, ...}
spinner = new Spinner(opts).spin(document.getElementById('spinner'))
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>That's it! The steps required to get Sinatra, CoffeeScript, and Haml playing together are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Install Barista</li>
<li>Configure Sinatra</li>
<li>Install a JavaScript runtime engine</li>
<li>Write some CoffeeScript</li>
</ul>


<p>In short, Barista and <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-nodejs/">Node</a> make Sinatra swing with CoffeeScript.</p>
