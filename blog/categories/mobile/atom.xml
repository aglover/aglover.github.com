    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>{% img left /images/mine/sealed.jpg %}Apple's app signing process can be a real pain-in-the-neck; nevertheless, it works to keep apps trusted. You know when you download a Bank of America app from iTunes that it's the real thing. You know that the app comes from <em>the</em> Bank of America.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Android allows apps to be self-signed. This has a fundamental flaw: an Android developer can claim to be anyone they want, <em>including Bank of America</em>. Thus, when you download an app from an Android App store, there's a real possibility that the app was submitted by a charlatan. What's more, those charlatan apps can actually be malicious!</p>

<p><a href="http://twitter.com/danieleran">Daniel Eran Dilger</a> has written an excellent article that features the differences between Apple's signing process and Google's. I highly recommend you read his article entitled "<a href="http://appleinsider.com/articles/13/07/14/editorial-googles-android-haunted-by-steve-jobs-warnings-on-app-signing-security">Google's Android haunted by Steve Jobs' warnings on app signing security</a>" as it sheds a bright light on the differences between the two mobile platforms; moreover, the article does a great job of outlining the evolution of iOS and its app security policies.</p>

By web logic, content is king; but for mobile users, interaction rules. Static information design is out for mobile apps, and gamification is in. This month Andrew Glover concludes his introduction to Android mobile development by adding a multiple-choice quiz feature to the example app, Overheard Word, introduced in a previous article. Then he shows you how to generate a digital signature and publish and promote your signed app on Google Play or Amazon Appstore for Android.

    <updated>2013-09-09T15:49:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://thediscoblog.com/blog/2013/09/09/8-percent-is-itty-bitty-but-it-matters</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I saw some news related to <a href="http://thediscoblog.com/blog/2012/12/02/comprehending-the-mobile-development-landscape/">Microsoft Windows Phone</a> that gave me pause for thought. Specifically, <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/ios-up-android-down-in-the-us-as-windows-phone-hits-eight-percent-in-europe-7000020117/">I read an article</a> that stated:</p>

<p>{% blockquote Liam Tung http://www.zdnet.com/ios-up-android-down-in-the-us-as-windows-phone-hits-eight-percent-in-europe-7000020117/ iOS up, Android down in the US as Windows Phone hits eight percent in Europe  %}
Microsoft's mobile platform reached new heights in the three months to July 2013 in Europe, making up 8.2 percent of sales across UK, France, Germany, Italy and Spain
{% endblockquote %}</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>While <a href="http://www.expertreviews.co.uk/smartphones/1301902/windows-phone-market-share-growing-in-europe">8.2% market share</a> might seem insignificant, what's interesting is that</p>

<p>{% blockquote Liam Tung http://www.zdnet.com/ios-up-android-down-in-the-us-as-windows-phone-hits-eight-percent-in-europe-7000020117/ iOS up, Android down in the US as Windows Phone hits eight percent in Europe %}
At the same time last year, Windows Phone accounted for 4.9 percent of sales
{% endblockquote %}</p>

<p>That is, <a href="http://wmpoweruser.com/kantar-windows-phone-hits-record-high-of-8-2-market-share-in-europe/">Windows Phone market share</a> for the same five markets has increased by a little more than 3% over the last year. Accordingly, Windows Phone is a <a href="http://thediscoblog.com/blog/2013/05/09/hold-your-horses-its-still-only-a-two-horse-race/">growing platform (in some markets)</a>, which means developers will eventually need to start considering it as a <a href="http://thediscoblog.com/blog/2013/05/09/hold-your-horses-its-still-only-a-two-horse-race/">third platform</a>. And throwing a third platform into the mix does change the variables in a native versus <a href="http://thediscoblog.com/blog/2013/04/05/crowd-think-often-lacks-clarity/">non-native</a> argument <em>in favor of an HTML5 approach</em>.</p>

<p>Microsoft has deep pockets and has <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-microsoft-ceo-steve-ballmers-failures-20130823,0,5988522,full.story">shown before</a> that it will fight (and hang on) to create a market for itself (i.e. Xbox and Bing). I suspect that Windows Phone will continue to gain market share, albeit slowly, mostly at the expense of nominal platforms like Blackberry.</p>

<p>Consequently, HTML5 will continue on its path as an advantageous development platform; moreover, HTML5's rise will <em>most likely be at the expense of hybrid frameworks</em> as there's a point of diminishing returns for <a href="http://thediscoblog.com/blog/2013/04/14/hybrid-inappropriateness/">frameworks</a> to support 100% of all native features across multiple native platforms. Plus, Amazon's recent announcement that their <a href="http://thediscoblog.com/blog/2013/08/07/why-amazon-appstores-support-of-html5-matters/">Appstore for Android supports the submission of HTML5 apps</a> only adds to the pro-HTML5 argument.</p>

<p>8% is an itty-bitty number, but I'll be keeping an eye on Microsoft's Windows Phone market share. And I'll be watching the world of HTML5 closely. How about you?</p>

    <id>http://thediscoblog.com/blog/2013/08/07/why-amazon-appstores-support-of-html5-matters</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>{% img right https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/mobile-apps/devportal2/content/sdk/images/webapps_icon-final-114.<em>V379662584</em>.png %}Today, Amazon announced that their <a href="http://www.amazon.com/mobile-apps/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=2350149011">Appstore for Android</a> <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/post/Tx2HGWRGOW5YG8/Amazon-is-Now-Accepting-HTML5-Web-Apps-Making-it-Easy-for-You-to-Reach-Millions.html">now supports the submission of HTML5 apps</a>. This is a game changer for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5">HTML5</a> because now there is a direct channel to consumers.</p>

<p>As I wrote almost a year ago:</p>

<p>{% blockquote thediscoblog.com http://thediscoblog.com/blog/2012/09/07/past-performance-is-no-guarantee-of-future-results/ Past Performance Is No Guarantee of Future Results %}
software delivery on the mobile platform is, at least for the foreseeable future, firmly established via app stores. And app stores cater to native apps (100% native and/or hybrid) only. The average person will not look for useful apps via their device’s browser: that route is still a jungle. And, at this point, there is no viable pure play mobile web app delivery channel.
{% endblockquote %}</p>

<p>Today, it's still true that the most convenient mechanism  for app delivery on mobile devices (and increasingly desktops) is via various app stores. And until today, HTML5 apps were not included in these app stores (unless they were wrapped by some hybrid-web container like <a href="http://thediscoblog.com/blog/2013/04/14/hybrid-inappropriateness/">PhoneGap</a>).</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>But now with Amazon's announcement, <a href="http://thediscoblog.com/blog/categories/html5/">HTML5</a> apps <em>without any native container</em> can be submitted into their Appstore. What's more, these apps can take advantage of monetization features like <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/sdk/webapps/iap/understanding.html">In-App purchasing</a> using Amazon's API.</p>

<p>Now HTML5 apps have a direct channel to consumers along with an API to make HTML5 app developers money. HTML5 apps are now icon-ized and people don't have to use a search engine to find them!</p>

<p>As <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/blog/author/Mike+Hines.html">Mike Hines</a> of Amazon puts it:</p>

<p>{% blockquote https://developer.amazon.com/blog/ https://developer.amazon.com/post/Tx2HGWRGOW5YG8/Amazon-is-Now-Accepting-HTML5-Web-Apps-Making-it-Easy-for-You-to-Reach-Millions.html Amazon is Now Accepting HTML5 Web Apps—Making it Easy for You to Reach Millions of Kindle Fire and Android Customers Worldwide %}
Starting today, you can submit your web apps and mobile optimized web sites and have them merchandised alongside native apps on Amazon and Kindle Fire in nearly 200 countries worldwide, without any third-party software or doing any native app development.
{% endblockquote %}</p>

<p>This is big news for HTML5 developers. A direct channel to the masses and monetization APIs to boot -- what more could you ask for? Standby folks because it's about to get even more interesting, as I'm willing to bet that Google and Apple will follow suit in the near future.</p>

    <link href="http://thediscoblog.com/blog/2013/07/30/adding-swipe-gestures-to-jquery-mobile-apps/"/>
    <updated>2013-07-30T12:52:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://thediscoblog.com/blog/2013/07/30/adding-swipe-gestures-to-jquery-mobile-apps</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>{% img left /images/mine/swipe-right.png %}I find that <a href="http://thediscoblog.com/blog/2013/04/07/painless-android-swipe-detection/">swipe gestures</a> for navigating between screens in a mobile app <a href="http://thediscoblog.com/blog/2013/07/01/mobile-for-the-masses-words-and-gestures-with-overheard-word/">quite nice</a>. <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/j-mobileforthemasses2/">Early on</a> in my mobile development journey, I found myself instinctively adding navigation buttons, but quickly found them cumbersome for users to tap; plus, those buttons took up precious screen real estate! Gestures, on the other hand, free up screen space by removing needless buttons and give users a more interactive experience.</p>

<p>Implementing right and left swipes in an <a href="http://jquerymobile.com/">jQuery Mobile</a> app is fairly straightforward, but there are a few gotchas that I was able to piece together via multiple <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7533772/how-to-swipe-between-several-jquery-mobile-pages">stackoverflow threads</a>, blogs, and finally <a href="http://api.jquerymobile.com/">jQuery Mobile's own documentation</a>.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>In a jQuery Mobile app, you <a href="http://the-jquerymobile-tutorial.org/jquery-mobile-tutorial-CH02.php">define pages</a> within <code>div</code> tags that represent a UI screen -- you can then declare transitions between pages well -- slide, flip, etc.  The key aspect with swiping between page <code>div</code>s is the selector for them, which is <code>div[data-role='page']</code>.</p>

<p>Once you have a handle to that <code>div</code>, you can proceed forward with a left swipe via jQuery's <a href="http://api.jquery.com/next/"><code>next</code></a> function. Conversely, swiping right with the intent of going back is facilitated by finding the previous matching <code>div[data-role='page']</code> via jQuery's <a href="http://api.jquery.com/prev/"><code>prev</code></a> function.</p>

<p>Also note, going backwards via a swipe requires that you <em>reverse</em> the slide transition, otherwise it looks misleading to the user (i.e. the transition is from left to right rather than the other way around!).</p>

<p>Accordingly, the JavaScript for swipe gestures should be placed within a <a href="http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.2.0/docs/api/events.html"><code>pageinit</code> event</a> like so:</p>

<p>``` javascript Enabling swipe between page divs
$(document).on('pageinit', function(event){
  $('div.ui-page').on("swipeleft", function () {</p>

<pre><code>var nextpage = $(this).next('div[data-role="page"]');
  if (nextpage.length &gt; 0) {
    $.mobile.changePage(nextpage, "slide", false, true);
  }
</code></pre>

<p>  });</p>

<p>  $('div.ui-page').on("swiperight", function () {</p>

<pre><code>var prevpage = $(this).prev('div[data-role="page"]');
if (prevpage.length &gt; 0) {
  $.mobile.changePage(prevpage, { transition: "slide", reverse: true }, true, true);
}
</code></pre>

<p>  });
});
```</p>

<p>Note, this script should be referenced in your DOM <em>before</em> you pull in the jQuery mobile js file. That is, put the code above where you add jQuery mobile in your document's header (but <em>after</em> you load jQuery itself):</p>

<p>``` html Including jQuery Mobile</p>

<script src="https://d10ajoocuyu32n.cloudfront.net/jquery-1.9.1.min.js"></script>


<!-- add pageinit swipe initialization here -->


<script src="https://d10ajoocuyu32n.cloudfront.net/mobile/1.3.1/jquery.mobile-1.3.1.min.js"></script>


<p>```</p>

<p>Once you've done that, you'll be able to swipe between page <code>div</code>s.</p>
