    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left" src="/images/mine/esbox.jpg">Are you looking to get going with <a href="http://thediscoblog.com/blog/categories/elasticsearch/">Elasticsearch</a> as quickly as possible without having to worry about <a href="http://thediscoblog.com/blog/2013/05/17/elasticsearch-on-ec2-in-less-than-60-seconds/">installing Java or Elasticsearch</a> itself? Are you looking for a repeatable and automated mechanism for bringing up Elasticsearch instances for developmental and or testing purposes? While there's certainly a number of <a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/">Elasticsearch</a>-as-a-platform service providers out there, there's one other option: use <a href="https://github.com/aglover/coffer">Elasticsearch-in-a-box</a>.</p>

<p>Elasticsearch-in-a-box is a freely available <a href="http://www.vagrantbox.es/">Vagrant base box</a>. What that means is that you can quickly fire up and tear down an Elasticsearch environment with <a href="http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/getting-started/">simple commands</a> like <code>vagrant up</code> and <code>vagrant destroy</code>.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>In order to use Elasticsearch-in-a-box, you first need to have <a href="http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/installation/">Vagrant</a> and <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a> installed. These two installations couldn't be any easier. To install <a href="http://thediscoblog.com/blog/2013/10/16/ssh-and-vagrant/">Vagrant</a>, simply go to the downloads page and pick your target distribution. Vagrant provisions machines on top of virtual machine providers like VMWare, <a href="http://thediscoblog.com/blog/categories/aws/">AWS</a>, and VirtualBox. VirtualBox is free and easy to install -- like Vagrant, simply <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">go to the downloads section</a> and pick your target platform.</p>

<p>Once you have both Vagrant and VirtualBox installed, you are two steps away from Elasticsearch-ing.</p>

<p>First, you need to add and initialize the Elasticsearch-in-a-box <a href="http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/boxes.html">template</a>. Go ahead and create a directory, like <code>/projects/esinabox</code>, change directories into it and execute this command:</p>

<p><code>bash This command will create a Vagrant definition named esinabox from the downloaded template
vagrant box add esinabox https://s3.amazonaws.com/coffers/esinabox.box
</code></p>

<p>This command will download the Elasticsearch-in-a-box template. Once that completes (it'll take a few moments depending on your connection), execute this command:</p>

<p><code>bash Vagrant init will create a VagrantFile
vagrant init 'esinabox'
</code></p>

<p>This command will create a <code>VagrantFile</code>, which you can use to customize the Elasticsearch-in-a-box instance. By default, you shouldn't need to do much, however, you can map network ports, install additional software via <a href="http://thediscoblog.com/blog/2013/11/18/provisioning-ubuntu-with-java-in-3-steps/">Bash</a>, Chef, and Puppet at your discretion.</p>

<p>Next, fire up Elasticsearch-in-a-box like so:</p>

<p><code>bash Starting up Elasticsearch-in-a-box
vagrant up
</code></p>

<p>Now that Elasticsearch-in-a-box is running locally on your machine, you can open up a new terminal and execute RESTful commands like normal because Elasticsearch is running on same ports: 9200 &amp; 9300. So go ahead and execute some queries, like so:</p>

<p><code>bash Elasticsearch is up an running!
curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/_status?pretty=true'
</code></p>

<p>And when you are done, go ahead and tear down the instance like so:</p>

<p><code>bash Destroying a VM instance
vagrant destroy -f
</code></p>

<p>Wasn't that easy? The Elasticsearch-in-a-box Vagrant template was built using <a href="https://github.com/jedi4ever/veewee">Veewee</a>. The base box is 64-bit <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/index_asus.html">Ubuntu 12.04</a> with Oracle's <a href="http://thediscoblog.com/blog/2013/11/18/provisioning-ubuntu-with-java-in-3-steps/">Java 7</a> and <a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/download/">Elasticsearch version 0.90.7</a>.</p>

<p>If you're looking for a quick and easy way to automatically provision Elasticsearch, then look no further and give <a href="https://github.com/aglover/coffer">Elasticsearch-in-a-box</a> a try!</p>

    <id>http://thediscoblog.com/blog/2013/11/18/provisioning-ubuntu-with-java-in-3-steps</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="right" src="/images/mine/ubuntu.png"> <a href="http://thediscoblog.com/blog/2013/10/16/ssh-and-vagrant/">As I've written about before</a>, <a href="http://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a> is handy tool for creating <a href="http://www.vagrantbox.es/">localized VMs</a>. It's a lot like firing up <a href="http://thediscoblog.com/blog/categories/aws/">EC2</a> images, but, for the most part, things are localized (you can, by the way, use Vagrant to <a href="https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant-aws">fire up EC2 images</a>). If you've ever used VMWare before, its the same thing, except Vagrant is free. You can create VMs of various operating systems, fire them up, and tear them down all with ease.</p>

<p>Vagrant plays nicely with hip DevOps frameworks like <a href="http://www.opscode.com/chef/">Chef</a> and <a href="http://puppetlabs.com/">Puppet</a> and if your installations require a number of components, then these tools are defiantly the way to go. Sometimes, however, a simple Bash script is good enough as in the case for auto-installing some base component, like <a href="http://thediscoblog.com/blog/categories/java/">Java</a>, <a href="http://thediscoblog.com/blog/categories/node/">Node.js</a> or <a href="http://thediscoblog.com/blog/categories/ruby/">Ruby</a>.</p>

<p>Using Vagrant's configuration file, aptly dubbed <code>Vagrantfile</code>, you can instruct a VM instance to run a series of steps -- these steps can be simple shell scripts, Chef cookbooks, or the Puppet equivalent.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Accordingly, the first step to provision an Ubuntu box with Java is to initialize a 64-bit <a href="http://thediscoblog.com/blog/categories/linux/">Ubuntu</a> 12.04 LTS (<a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PrecisePangolin">Precise Pangolin</a>) instance. You can do this via the <code>vagrant init</code> command like so:</p>

<p><code>bash Initializing a Vagrant box
$&gt; vagrant init ubuntu.lts.64 http://files.vagrantup.com/precise64.box
</code></p>

<p>This creates a <code>Vagrantfile</code> in the directory where you ran the command and creates a named VM (i.e. "ubuntu.lts.64") that is based off of Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.</p>

<p>Base Ubuntu installations do not come with Java; if you'd like to install a particular JDK, say Oracle's JDK 7, you can leverage <a href="https://github.com/aglover/ubuntu-equip">ubuntu-equip</a>, which is a series of Bash scripts that install various components like Java, Node.js, MongoDB, Redis, Ruby, etc.</p>

<p>Thus, for step 2, open up the newly created <code>Vagrantfile</code> and you should see two lines like so:</p>

<p>``` ruby A basic VagrantFile contains the box and box_url attributes
config.vm.box = 'ubuntu.lts.64'</p>

<h1>a few comments...</h1>

<p>config.vm.box_url = 'http://files.vagrantup.com/precise64.box'
```</p>

<p>After the <code>vm.box_url</code> declaration, insert the following line:</p>

<p><code>ruby Installing Java
config.vm.provision :shell, inline: 'wget --no-check-certificate https://github.com/aglover/ubuntu-equip/raw/master/equip_java7_64.sh &amp;&amp; bash equip_java7_64.sh'
</code></p>

<p>This command instructs the instance to run an inline Bash command once it is up and running, which in this case auto-installs Oracle's Java 7 JDK (see the <a href="https://github.com/aglover/ubuntu-equip">ubuntu-equip</a> project for more information).</p>

<p>Save your <code>VagrantFile</code> and then, for step 3, run the following command in the same directory:</p>

<p><code>bash Firing up a new VM
$&gt; vagrant up
</code></p>

<p>If this is the first time firing up this particular VM, you should see some text indicating that a particular box is being downloaded. Once the download is complete, the instance will boot up and subsequently invoke the inline provision command that kicks off the installation of Java.</p>

<p>If all goes well, you should see a lot of text scroll by ending with:</p>

<p><code>bash Java is installed!
java version "1.7.0_25"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.7.0_25-b15)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 23.25-b01, mixed mode)
</code></p>

<p>And that's it. To use the VM, <a href="http://thediscoblog.com/blog/2013/10/16/ssh-and-vagrant/">simply SSH to it</a>. Go ahead and type <code>java -version</code> just to convince yourself. Go ahead, I'll wait for you...there, are you happy now?  Wasn't that easy? Provisioning Ubuntu VMs with Vagrant couldn't be any easier with <a href="https://github.com/aglover/ubuntu-equip">ubuntu-equip</a>, dig it?</p>
