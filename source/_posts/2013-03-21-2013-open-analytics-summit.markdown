{% img right left http://www.openanalyticssummit.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/OAS-logo-Full-colour3-300x85.png %}On March 25, 2013, [I'll be speaking](http://www.openanalyticssummit.com/speakers/) at the [Open Analytics Summit in Washington DC](http://www.openanalyticssummit.com/); specifically, I'll be discussing how the [App47](http://www.app47.com/2013/03/20/next-monday-app47-cto-andy-glover-offers-a-database-reality-check-at-the-open-analytics-summit/) team has used [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/) as the backend of our enterprise mobile application management platform. We've learned quite a few things about [Mongo](http://thediscoblog.com/blog/categories/mongodb/) over the last two years! In the process of growing from a few gigabytes of data a month to over a terabyte/month, we've found out first hand what [Mongo](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/training/kp/j-kp-mongo/) is good at and what it's _not good at_. I'll be addressing a number of tips, techniques, and strategies -- if you are a Mongo user or planning on being one, come on by!
