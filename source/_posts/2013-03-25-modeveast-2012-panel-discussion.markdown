Last fall, I had the pleasure of moderating a panel discussion at [MoDevEast](http://modeveast.com/) entitled "[What Developers Love and Hate about iOS, Android, Windows and HTML5](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7P-wNuHPL0)" with five super star mobile app developers.

The panelists are a diverse set, which made the interaction a lot of fun as each had unique perspectives. Check out what my friends [Ryan McGeary](https://twitter.com/rmm5t), Steve Jernigan, Michael Shapard, [Andrew Trice](https://twitter.com/andytrice), and Chris Kamsler have to say!
