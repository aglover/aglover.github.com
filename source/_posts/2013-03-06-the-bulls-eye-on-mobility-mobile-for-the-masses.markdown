{% img left /images/mine/mftm_1.jpg %}Since joining [App47](http://www.app47.com/), I've been lazer focused on mobility; consquently, I'm pleased to announce that a new mobile development series has debuted on [IBM developerWorks](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/)! The inaugural article,  "[A gentle introduction to Android](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/j-mobileforthemasses1/)", begins by exploring the mobile landscape and introduces how to get started with Android app development. 

As the article summary states: 

{% blockquote IBM DeveloperWorks http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/j-mobileforthemasses1/ Mobile for the masses: A gentle introduction to Android %}
The mobile landscape is rich with promise, and Android is a viable and exciting platform for developers who seek a way in. This new series starts with an introduction to Android that is tailored specifically for Java developers just getting started with mobile. Learn about Android's three-layer versioning system (and find out why it matters), then set up your development environment and build your first Android app.
{% endblockquote %}
